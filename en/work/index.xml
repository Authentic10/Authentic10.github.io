First, we defined a set of questions. Then we created graphs to answer these questions and finally, we commented on these graphs. Fatal Encounters documents non-police deaths that occur when police are present or are precipitated by police action or presence. It documents all available records for all 50 states of USA, back to 2000. The general ouline of this post is as follows : Part 1 : Exploration Visualisation based on race Visualization based on state Other visualizations Part 2 : Summary Part 1 : Exploration 1.</description></item><item><title>Fruits and Vetgetables Recognition</title><link>https://atchagnaou.me/en/work/fruits-and-vegetables/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://atchagnaou.me/en/work/fruits-and-vegetables/</guid><description>This project is a web application to test an image recognition model trained on various fruits and vegetables with Azure Custom Vision.
